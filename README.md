A full-stack job finding MERN app developed by Arash Jangali.

This comprehensive application allows users to create an account, build personalized profiles, match with potential job opportunities or talented freelancers, and engage in real-time chat.
Whether you are a freelancer or a client, the app caters to your needs.

Designed with a focus on desktop usability. A good experience for users on larger screens. While the app prioritizes desktop functionality, it is worth noting that the responsiveness on smaller screens may vary. Efforts have been made to ensure compatibility across different devices, but the app's design may not provide an optimal experience on mobile or tablet devices.

Please keep in mind that certain features and layouts may not be fully optimized for smaller screens. However, the app's core functionalities and main features are accessible, allowing you to navigate, interact, and accomplish your goals.

Future iterations of the app may incorporate responsive design techniques to enhance the experience on various devices. Your feedback is valuable in driving improvements and shaping the app's evolution.

For the best experience, I recommend accessing the app on a desktop.
